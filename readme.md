# Mortgage Simulation Tool
Recently I learned that morgages calculate interest daily! 

This provoked me to explore how much you can save by overpaying your morgage each month. So, I built a Python tool for simulating mortgage repayment with daily compound interest, fixed monthly payments, and optional extra mid-month overpayments(this is arbituary time of the month off the extra payment has little effect).  

Useful for comparing scenarios such as *standard repayment* vs *overpaying £X per month* to see the effect on **total interest paid**.
